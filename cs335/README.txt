INTRO: This program will display the outcome of the Cella Rule 90. The algorithm used is 
	a simple brute force style algorithm that uses an "if statement driven" FSM on an 
	array to enact the rules of the algorithm.

Folder Contains: js-1(main file), assets(folder with drawstuff.js and css), and README.txt

External Req's: None 

Features: Has a grid to 400 pixels, title, and working display of algorithm. Size and spacing
	  can be completely customized. But algorithm is not recursive.

Bugs: None
--------------------------------------------------------------------

How to handle the JS-1 files to get results:

1. Main HTML file is js-1.html, a web page.
2. Sibling folder (at same level as .html) is "assets".
  (You can move this folder elsewhere if you change js-1.html accordingly.)
3. Web page links to (loads) assets/styles.css, a very simple CSS file.
4. Web page has some HTML markup for title, header and text.
5. After body, web page loads a script file from assets with fcns.
6. After that, Cella Rule 90 algorithm runs and displays.

How to show (and run) the web page:
7. Drag and drop the html file onto a browser to see what it does.
7(alternative). Copy js-1 and assets folder to your computer's wamp64 -> www directory
8. Make sure all files (js-1 and assets folder) are in the same directory
9. Run WAMP server and search localhost/js-1 in your web browser

(*) Key: use fcn key F12 to open a "javascript console" in your browser
and see what might be going wrong: errors and warnings.
